# cs279-todo-app-observablehq

This app is built upon the following tutorial: https://observablehq.com/@alejandrokennedy/d3-redux-and-redux-undo-todo-list. 

To run the app locally, navigate to the folder, and run 
```
npx http-server
```

If http-server is not installed, just follow the instructions in the terminal to install it first.

Then, the app should be hosted at http://127.0.0.1:8080
